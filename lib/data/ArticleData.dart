 Announced on September 7, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are Apple's new high-end flagship smartphones, being sold alongside the lower-cost iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro models are much more feature rich than the iPhone 14 models, offering camera technology improvements, better display capabilities, a faster A16 chip, and more.
              
 The 6.1 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro models look like the iPhone 13 Pro models with flat edges, stainless steel enclosure, a textured matte glass back, IP68 water resistance, and a Ceramic Shield-protected display, but the camera bumps are larger to accommodate new lenses, and the display has also changed.
              
 There is no longer a notch for the TrueDepth camera system, with Apple instead adopting what it calls the Dynamic Island, a pill-shaped cutout at the front of the display that houses camera equipment and can change in shape and size using software depending on what's on the screen.
              
 Apple says the Dynamic Island is meant to blend the line between hardware and software. It is able to adapt in real time, showing alerts, notifications, and activities in the space where the notch used to be. There is still hardware under there, but the TrueDepth camera takes up less space and the Dynamic Island makes it blend into the background by taking better advantage of the screen. The Dynamic Island can show payment confirmations with Face ID, Maps directions, phone calls, music information, Live Activities like sports scores, timers, and more, plus it can be interacted with using a tap and hold gesture.
              
 The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max feature a new Super Retina XDR display with updated ProMotion technology that allows for an Always-On display, a first for an iPhone. The Always-On display is made possible through a new 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate along with improved power efficient technologies. When the Always-On display is active, the time, widgets, and Live Activities remain available at a glance at all times, and the wallpaper is dimmed.

 Top iOS 17 Features
Below we've listed many of the top features in the new version of the operating system, and we'll continue to add notable changes as the beta progresses. For the full list of changes, you can read Apple's website. 

Fresh Contact Posters
Contact Posters are like pretty business cards but for when you're calling someone already in your address book. You can customize the screen that will pop up when anyone gets your call (if they have an iPhone) with a photo or Memoji of yourself, and throw in a custom font and color. These will work with third-party calling apps and will also pop up in your Contacts app and other areas where you share your information, such as NameDrop. 

    AirDrop and NameDrop
What's NameDrop? It's an AirDrop feature that lets you put two iPhones next to each other to share contact information with the other person. You can choose on the screen what emails and phone numbers you want to share. (It's very reminiscent of Bump and Android Beam, both of which are now defunct.)  Bringing two iPhones together won't just trigger NameDrop though. You can also use this action to share content or start SharePlay activities together, like listening to the same music.  

AirDrop is also getting a big upgrade. Now, if someone is sharing high-res media with you and it's going to take some time, you don't need to stand next to them and wait for the transfer to complete. You can step away and the files will be sent over the internet. Apple specifies that this feature will be “coming later this year,” so it may launch a little after iOS 17 rolls out. 

Live Voicemail
Google may have Call Screen on its Pixel phones that shows a live transcription of a call before you answer it, but iPhones are getting a similar feature that's less about avoiding spam or robocalls and more aimed at voicemails. When someone leaves you a voicemail, you'll be able to see it being transcribed on your screen in real time. You can then choose to answer the call immediately if it's important.
